# Other Parts

- [Part 1](../part-1-building-a-xor-patched-vpn-server/): A guide on building the actual VPN server. This explains a lot of the terminology too, so make sure to give it a read if you haven't since this guide will definitely build off of it in some areas.
- [Part 2](../part-2-the-patched-desktop-clients/): The second part of this wonderful guide. Goes into an in-depth guide on building or finding the desktop clients (macOS, Linux, Windows) so you can actually connect to this VPN server from any Desktop Platform.

# Final Remarks

Congratulations! You've made the VPN profiles that we made in the last guide useful by configuring your own XOR-patched OpenVPN clients (mobile this time)! There is a discussion available below if you have any questions, so feel free to ask there or email me at [tmthecoder@gmail.com](mailto:tmthecoder@gmail.com). Thanks for reading and I hope you learned something!
